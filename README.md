# Untangled

## The Premise
This game is our take on the Flash game, Planarity. The goal of the game is to move the vertices in such a way that no edges intersect. A level is considered solves when no edges intersect.

## Story Mode
Play and complete story mode and save the Knitted Kingdoom or something in this epic mode where you play pre-made levels by us, the creators and attempt to beat our personal bests! Featuring at least 1 world and 5 levels!

## Endless Mode
Story mode too short? Want to really test your **EPIC GAMER** skill? Try your hand at Endless Mode! Compete in an endless amount of randomly generated levels to get as far as you can! WIth a total of *two* difficulty stages, this mode is bound to be fun for the whole family. Compete against the clock on Challenge Mode, or take the easy way out and play Casual Mode 

*Note: Levels generated in this mode are not guaranteed to be solvable.

## The Level Editor
Are all these modes not enough for you? Do you crave more from our hastily put together game? If you answered yes to both or one of these questions, try out the Level Editor in the Settings menu!

The Level Editor allows you to create your own levels, and save these to play for yourself! (And maybe others in the future idk).

Place a vertex with the left mouse button, and connect two vertices by right clicking vertices you wish to connect. 

*"The Level Editor! Because we're too lazy to keep making more levels!"*
